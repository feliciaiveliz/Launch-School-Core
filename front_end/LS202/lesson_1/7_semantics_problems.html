    <h1>Lincoln's Gettysburg Address</h1>
    <p>
      Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
      continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
      proposition that all men are created equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
      or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are
      met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a
      portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave
      their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
      proper that we should do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we
      can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
      struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
      detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say
      here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the
      living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they
      who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
      to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from
      these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
      they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly
      resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation,
      under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of
      the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
      earth.

-> article 

(3) Given the HTML from question 2, would it be appropriate to replace <sometag> with <address> or <blockquote>? If so, which one?
It could be a blockquote because it can be understood by itself. It can be wrapped in 'article'
<article>
  <blockquote>
    <h1>Lincoln's Gettysburg Address</h1>
    <p>Four score and seven years ago ...</p>
    <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war...</p>
    <p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate...</p>
  </blockquote>
</article>

(4) Given the following HTML, would <section>, <aside>, <article>, or <div> be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as <sometag>?
  <sometag>
    <h3>Text-align Property</h3>
    <p>
      Given the width of the paragraph, the heading looks odd hanging out on
      the left side of the screen. Let's center it instead; we'll do this
      with the text-align property:
    <p>
  
    <pre>
      <h1 style="color: orange; text-align: center;">Hello, Internet!</h1>
    </pre>
  </sometag>
-> section because it could be part of a larger part of the document - but isn't a standalone piece of work

(5) Given the following HTML, would <aside>, <section>, <blockquote>, or <div> be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as <sometag>?
  <h3>Hex Colors</h3>

  <p>
    Most graphics and design applications like Photoshop and Pixelmator
    display colors in hexadecimal format, so it's easy to copy and paste
    color values you need from one program into your editor as a CSS
    property.
  </p>
  
  <sometag>
    <p>
      If you're unfamiliar with the hexadecimal numbering system, it uses 16
      different digits instead of the ten the decimal system uses. The hex
      digits are 0 through 9, as in the decimal system, but also include a
      through f (or A through F) as valid digits.
    </p>
  </sometag>
-> aside because it seems connected to the previous paragraph and not part of the main body of the document
