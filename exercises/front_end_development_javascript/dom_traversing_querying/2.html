<!-- Further Exploration:
Write code that returns the number of direct and indirect child nodes for a given parent node as an array. -->

<!-- algorithm:
- get the element by id (ex. id = 1)
  - set 'result' to []
- get the child nodes of the current node
  - get the length of the child nodes array and push to 'result'
  - set 'count' to 0
  - loop through child nodes of current node
    - get child nodes array of current child node and length
    - update 'count' by length
  - repeat for each child node
  - push 'count' to 'result'
- return 'result'
