// Vigenere Cipher
// The Vigenere Cipher encrypts alphabetic text using polyalphabetic substitution. It uses a series of Caesar Ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. Each letter of the keyword is treated as a shift value. For instance, the letter 'B' corresponds to a shift value of 1, and the letter 'd' corresponds to a shift value of 3. In other words, the shift value used for a letter is equal to its index value in the alphabet. This means that the letters 'a'-'z' are equivalent to the numbers 0-25. The uppercase letters 'A'-'Z' are also equivalent to 0-25.

// Applying the Vigenere Cipher is done sequentially for each character by applying the current shift value to a Caesar Cipher for that particular character. To make this more concrete, let's look at the following example:

// plaintext: Pineapples don't go on pizzas!
// keyword: meat

// Applying the Vigenere Cipher for each alphabetic character:
// plaintext : Pine appl esdo ntgo onpi zzas
// shift     : meat meat meat meat meat meat
// ciphertext: Bmnx mtpe qwdh zxgh arpb ldal

// result: Bmnxmtpeqw dhz'x gh ar pbldal!

// Notice that in the example, the key isn't moved forward if the character isn't in the alphabet. Like the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenere Cipher only encrypts alphabetic characters.

// Write a function that implements the Vigenere Cipher. The case of the keyword doesn't matterâ€”in other words, the resulting encryption won't change depending on the case of the keyword's letters (e.g., 'MEat' === 'mEaT').

// For a quick lookup of a ciphertext per character, you may consult this tabula recta. Each row of the table corresponds to a Caesar Cipher encryption using the columns' character letter as a shift value.

Understand the Problem
----------------------
- Input:
  - plaintext: any sequence of characters
  - keyword: any sequence of characters; case does not matter
- Output:
  - new string 'ciphertext': a sequence of characters
  - it has the same number of characters as the 'plaintext'
  - it is the 'encrypted' version of the 'plaintext'
- Rules:
  - the vigenere cipher is a series of caeser ciphers
  - each character of the keyword is a 'shift' value
    - the shift value as the key the cipher uses to encrypt a plaintext letter
    - the v. cipher uses multiple key values
  - assume that keyword will only contain letters
  - case does not matter
  - sequentially apply the shift values to each alphabetic character, using a Caeser cipher
  - each shift value is used one at a time repetitevly for all alphabetic chars. in 'ciphertext'
  - the shift value wraps around when it exceeds 'z', 'Z'
